    - Focused on front-end development, creating reusable codebases and optimizing for performance and user engagement.
- **Skills Gained:** Front-end development, UI/UX design, component-based architecture, JavaScript frameworks.

## Year 2: Mobile and Backend Development (2023-2024)
- **Technologies:** Swift, Go, Gin, Docker
- **Overview:** Expanded into mobile development with Swift, creating a fully functional iOS application. Simultaneously learned Go and built scalable backends using the Gin framework.
- **Key Projects:**
    - **Nutrition Tracker iOS App**: Designed and developed a mobile application to provide users with detailed nutritional information, integrating APIs for food data and delivering a seamless user experience.
    - Built a RESTful backend with Go and Gin, implementing secure APIs to support several of my mobile and web projects.
- **Skills Gained:** Mobile app development, iOS programming, backend development, API design, Go programming. Containerization with Docker.

## Year 3: Advanced Full-Stack, Embedded, and AI Development (2024-2025)
- **Technologies:** Next.js, Server-Side Rendering (SSR), CLEAN Architecture, STM32, Bare-Metal Programming, PCB Design, Python, NumPy, Pandas, LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK, FastAPI
- **Overview:** Mastered advanced web development with Next.js and SSR, implementing robust authentication and authorization systems. Ventured into embedded systems, developing applications for STM32 microcontrollers, including custom bare-metal drivers. Designed a PCB for a hardware project. In late 2025, focused on AI and agent workflows, leveraging Pythonâ€™s data science and AI libraries to build intelligent applications.
- **Key Projects:**
    - **Next.js Full-Stack Application**: Developed a [Web Academy](https://academy.imnextgen.bg) for [I&M NextGen](https://imnextgen.bg) using Next.js with SSR, incorporating CLEAN Architecture, Clerk authentication, and role-based authorization with Cerbos for scalable, secure performance.
    - **STM32 Embedded Applications**: Created multiple applications for STM32, including one with hand-written bare-metal drivers at the register level, optimizing hardware performance. Designed a custom PCB for a device which simulates potentiometer.
    - **AI-Driven Workflow System**: Built an AI-powered application using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and LangGraph, integrated with a FastAPI backend to enable intelligent agent workflows.
- **Skills Gained:** Full-stack development, server-side rendering, CLEAN Architecture, embedded systems, bare-metal programming, PCB design, AI development, agent-based workflows, FastAPI integration.
